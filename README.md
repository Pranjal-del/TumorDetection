Trained a machine learning model to accurately detect tumors using Scikit-learn liabrary in python.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.

Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

Achieved a model accuracy of 95% in tumor detection by implementing random forest algorithm.
